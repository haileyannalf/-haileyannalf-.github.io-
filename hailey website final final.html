      <p id="aboutme"> Hi! My name is Hailey Alf, and I was born on November 13, 1998. I graduated a year early from Norcross High School in 2016 with a 3.87 GPA. I currently attend the University of Georgia with a major in Finance and a minor in French. I was previous employed as a babysitter for 6 years, and as a sales associate at Bevello for six months.</p>
<p> My hobbies include swim team, National Charity League, guitar, speaking French, and Paws Club at UGA. Through National Charity League, I have volunteered at Foster Care Support Warehouse, Spruill Center of the Arts Camp, Community Assistance Center, Dorothy Benson Center, and Mt. Vernon Towers (a retirement home). Additionally, I was a freshman scholar and a diamond girl at Norcross High School. As a freshman scholar, I tutored and advised freshman during my guided study. As a diamond girl, I went to every baseball game and recorded each play in the record book. </p> 
<p> I have won several awards, including the Community Service Award, 2 Varsity Letters in Academics, and National Honors Society. I won the Community Service Award from Norcross High School for having over 200 recorded volunteer hours. The varsity letters in Academics and National Honors Society were awarded to me by Norcross High School for my academic achievement. Below is a table summarizing my achievements and above is a link to the website for National Charity League. </p>
